## Description

The Discord OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Bot is a powerful tool that utilizes the Tesseract OCR engine to read text from images sent in Discord channels. Upon receiving an image, the bot processes it, extracts any text present, and then sends the extracted text in an embed message. It has the capacity to selectively operate in specified channels and can acknowledge messages with specific reactions.

## Features
- Automatic OCR: Instantly converts images sent in specified channels into text.
- Real-time feedback: Reacts to images with a üîç emoji to indicate that OCR is in progress.
- Supports only image files: Ensures non-image attachments are ignored.
- Displays text in a neatly formatted embed.
